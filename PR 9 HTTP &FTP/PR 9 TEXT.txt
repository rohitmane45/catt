ftp :

FTP Steps
1. Take two host machine , one switch (2950-24),
Router 1841 , one server server-pt

2. First go to router check interface by which it
connected to server as it show f/a o then click on
router and go-to interface click on and then put
IP address any as per your choice like 10.10.10.1

3. Similarly give ip for second interface from some
different range of classful addressing like class c
192.168.0.1 as this is the default getway for your
host machines

4.Now give IP configuration to you host machines
like 192.168.0.2 & 192.168.0.3 give default
getway is 192.168.0.1

5. Last go to server desktop and give IP 10.10.10.2
and default getway is 10.10.10.1

6.Goto Server services and click on FTP and do
steps as below and then click on add

7.Now click on host machine no 1 and goto text
editor and write content as per your choice

8. Save file with extension .txt and say ok

9. Then goto same machine’s cmd and first check
you machine connected to server or not .

10. Then write ftp 10.10.10.2 after this you can
ask for user name and pswd then you will get
logged in


11. To upload file need to add command put
(filename) jyot.txt

12 dir enter

13.for download need to go another machine again
goto cmd of another macjhine and write ftp
10.10.10.2 enter

14. get jyot.txt (filename)




HTTP Steps

1. Take two host machine
2. Take one server (server - PT server0)
3. Take one switch
4.Give IP address as shown in fig (go tt desktop and give for server also )
5. Server IP address must be a default getaway of
host machine.
6.Go to server then click on services tab then go for http services if it is off then on it.
7. Then at the last you will get on same tab
index.html file then click on it first and then click
on edit the script will get open .
You can edit as per your choice as shown below
8.Again Edit as below
9. Click on save button then again click on yes then
close it.
10.Then Again click on server and go to desktop and then go-to web browser
11.Then the IP you gave to your server need to put in URL tab and click on go .
12.You will get final output like
So you may change all things as you already have web technology subject 




Here’s a **complete set of Viva Questions (Basic → Intermediate → Hard)** for both **FTP** and **HTTP practicals** based on your CN (Computer Networks) manual and SPPU pattern.

## 🔹 **Practical: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

### 🧩 **1. Basic Viva Questions**

1. What does FTP stand for?
   → FTP stands for **File Transfer Protocol**.

2. What is the purpose of FTP?
   → FTP is used to **transfer files** between a client and a server over a network.

3. Which layer of the OSI model does FTP belong to?
   → FTP works at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)**.

4. What are the two modes of FTP?
   → **Active Mode** and **Passive Mode**.

5. What are the default ports used by FTP?
   → Port **21** for control connection and port **20** for data transfer.

6. What is the difference between FTP client and FTP server?
   → FTP client requests file transfers, and FTP server responds to those requests.

7. What command is used to connect to an FTP server?
   → `ftp <server_ip>`

8. What command is used to upload a file in FTP?
   → `put <filename>`

9. What command is used to download a file in FTP?
   → `get <filename>`

10. What command is used to see the list of files on the FTP server?
    → `dir` or `ls`

---

### ⚙️ **2. Intermediate Viva Questions**

1. What is the difference between FTP and TFTP?
   → FTP uses TCP (reliable) while TFTP uses UDP (unreliable).

2. Why do we need a username and password in FTP?
   → To ensure **authentication and secure access** to files on the server.

3. Can we transfer binary files using FTP?
   → Yes, by switching to **binary mode** using the `binary` command.

4. What is anonymous FTP?
   → It allows users to log in using the username **anonymous** and no password.

5. What happens if you don’t provide the correct gateway in host configuration?
   → The host cannot communicate with devices in other networks (like the FTP server).

6. Why do we configure two interfaces on the router in this setup?
   → To connect two different networks (server side and host side) and enable routing.

7. What is the purpose of `ping` command before using FTP?
   → To verify **network connectivity** between client and server.

8. What is the role of the switch in this practical?
   → To connect multiple host machines to the same network.

9. Why is FTP considered insecure?
   → Because it transmits data (including username and password) in **plain text**.

10. Which protocol can be used instead of FTP for secure file transfer?
    → **SFTP (Secure FTP)** or **FTPS**.

---

### 🔐 **3. Hard/Conceptual Viva Questions**

1. Explain the control and data connection in FTP.
   → Control connection handles commands and responses, while data connection handles the actual file transfer.

2. Describe the sequence of steps when a file is uploaded using FTP.
   →

   * Client connects to server using port 21.
   * User authenticates (username/password).
   * Client sends `put` command.
   * Server opens a data connection (port 20).
   * File is transferred.

3. How does FTP ensure reliable data transfer?
   → FTP uses **TCP** which ensures data delivery, error checking, and retransmission.

4. How does routing enable communication between different networks in this setup?
   → The router forwards packets between two networks (192.168.0.x and 10.10.10.x).

5. What happens if you don’t start the FTP service on the server?
   → The client will not be able to connect; the connection request will fail.

6. What command can be used to check current FTP mode (binary or ASCII)?
   → Use `status` command.

7. What happens if two clients upload a file with the same name?
   → The latest uploaded file overwrites the previous one (unless permissions prevent it).

## 🔹 **Practical: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

### 🧩 **1. Basic Viva Questions**

1. What does HTTP stand for?
   → **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**.

2. What is the main purpose of HTTP?
   → It is used for **transferring web pages** from a web server to a web browser.

3. Which layer does HTTP belong to in the OSI model?
   → **Application Layer (Layer 7)**.

4. What is the default port number for HTTP?
   → **Port 80**.

5. What is the default port number for HTTPS?
   → **Port 443**.

6. What is the function of a web browser?
   → It acts as a **client** that requests and displays web content.

7. What file is used by default by the HTTP server to display the home page?
   → `index.html`

8. What protocol does HTTP use for transport?
   → **TCP**

9. What does the term “web server” mean?
   → A server that hosts and serves web pages using the HTTP protocol.

10. What does URL stand for?
    → **Uniform Resource Locator**.

---

### ⚙️ **2. Intermediate Viva Questions**

1. What happens when we type the IP address of the server in the browser’s URL bar?
   → The browser sends an **HTTP GET request** to the server to fetch the web page.

2. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
   → HTTPS adds **encryption** using SSL/TLS for secure communication.

3. What is the function of the HTTP service on the server in Packet Tracer?
   → It allows the server to respond to HTTP requests from clients (hosts).

4. Why must the server IP address be set as the default gateway for host machines?
   → So that packets can be routed correctly to and from the server.

5. What is the role of “index.html” file in the web server?
   → It is the default webpage displayed when accessing the server’s IP.

6. What happens if HTTP service is off on the server?
   → The client’s web browser will show “Connection refused” or “Page not found”.

7. What is the purpose of editing the HTML script in the server?
   → To customize the web page content as per the user’s design.

8. Can you access the server using a hostname instead of IP in Packet Tracer?
   → Only if a **DNS server** is configured.

9. Which command-line tool can also test HTTP connectivity?
   → `ping <server_ip>` (to test network), or `curl <server_ip>` (to test HTTP, in real systems).

10. Why does HTTP use TCP and not UDP?
    → Because HTTP needs **reliable and ordered delivery** of web content.

---

### 🔐 **3. Hard/Conceptual Viva Questions**

1. Explain how HTTP works.
   → HTTP is a **request–response protocol** where the client sends a request (GET/POST), and the server responds with HTML or other resources.

2. What are HTTP methods?
   → Common methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.

3. What is a status code in HTTP?
   → A 3-digit number that shows the result of a request (e.g., **200 OK**, **404 Not Found**, **500 Server Error**).

4. How does HTTPS secure data transfer?
   → By using **SSL/TLS encryption**, which encrypts data between client and server.

5. What will happen if you enter the wrong IP address in the web browser?
   → The browser will show an error: **“Request timed out”** or **“Page not found”**.

6. What is the difference between a web server and an application server?
   → Web server handles HTTP requests; application server can process business logic and dynamic content.

7. What is the function of the switch in this setup?
   → It connects multiple hosts in the same LAN to communicate with the server.

8. What happens when two hosts access the server simultaneously?
   → The server handles multiple connections using separate TCP sessions.
